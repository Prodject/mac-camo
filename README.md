### Dependencies:
> <h5>superuser (<code>sudo</code>/<code>su</code>)</h5>
 
## What is it?
> <code>mac-camo</code> allows users to search for a MAC manufacturer and spoof their MAC Address as one of that manufacturer.
## Why?
> <code>mac-camo</code> is intended for anonymity<sup>1</sup> (or the exact opposite!<sup>2</sup>). <br />
> > <sup>1</sup>For example, I might be in a café where everyone is using Dell computers and I'm using a Mac. I could run the script, search for <code>Dell</code>, and spoof my MAC as a Dell computer so that anyone scanning the network would see my IP Address from Dell and not Apple. <br /> <br />
> > <sup>2</sup>However, if I wanted to be the opposite of anonymous, I could do something like this:
> > > I'm at a business where every device is Apple. I use this script and make it something really unexpected, like <code>GoPro</code> or even <code>Raspberry Pi Foundation</code> to startle, scare, or surprise scanners and security researchers.
